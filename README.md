<h1>Movie Generator</h1>
<p>This project consists of a simple landing page for a website that generates movie posters. It was used mostly to practice react components, props,state and hooks.
I made a simple API call in order to get the data about movies from www.omdbapi.com and it works pretty well. Also Vercel was used for deploiment and you can find the online version of this project here at https://movie-generator-rho.vercel.app/ .


--LATER EDIT--
<p>Aparently the API failed to work in the deploied version of the page so a local install is required to test everything. The issue is related to the fact that the page was loaded over HTTPS and that it requested an insecure resource thus blocking it. I will try to fix this and update the code.</p>
